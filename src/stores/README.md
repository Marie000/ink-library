# Stores

This is where most of our existing state management takes place (except for the reading UI which had transitioned to what was intended to be the new state system in `state`). It's very cluttered. A lot of it is now unused as it belongs to earlier, very different, designs or implementations.

Almost all of these are implemented as [regular Svelte stores.](https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_store)
